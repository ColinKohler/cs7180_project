# TODO:
- Decoder input/hidden
    1. No input (Robin thinks maybe not bad) 
    2. Encoder hidden state as input, repeatedly
    3. Encoder output as input, init decoder hidden with encoder hidden, loop over input
    4. Decncoder ouptut as input (seq to seq strategy)
- x_t for find/relocate might need to be different
