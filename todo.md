# TODO:
- Prototype model using simplified dataset - keep modules as simple/few as possible. Jupyter notebook?
- Run prototype model on full shapes dataset (need more modules than before)
- Compare our model with theirs in terms of number of weights, parameters, training time, etc.
- Describe the functions of the various modules
- Iron out gridworld dataset details (samples, commands, etc)
